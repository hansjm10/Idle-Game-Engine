# Idle Engine Monorepo

This repository hosts the idle-game engine, reference content packs, presentation shells, and supporting services described in `docs/idle-engine-design.md`.

## Environment
- Node: 22.20.0 (pinned for deterministic coverage). Run `nvm use` from the repo root to adopt the version from `.nvmrc`.
- pnpm: 10.18.1 or newer (see `packageManager` field). Install via `corepack enable` or your package manager.

## Structure
- `packages/` – core runtime and client-facing packages.
- `services/` – backend services (leaderboards, guilds, auth integrations).
- `tools/` – developer tooling such as content validators and simulation CLIs.
- `docs/` – design documents and technical specs.

Refer to the design document for roadmap and subsystem detail.

## Testing
- `pnpm test:a11y` runs the Playwright-based accessibility smoke suite against the web shell via `tools/a11y-smoke-tests/scripts/run-playwright.cjs`. The harness starts preview/dev servers sequentially with `start-server-and-test`, so invoking `pnpm exec playwright test` directly now requires you to boot compatible servers first (the suite exits early with guidance if it cannot reach them). Use `PLAYWRIGHT_DEV_PORT`/`PLAYWRIGHT_PREVIEW_PORT` to point at existing `pnpm dev`/`pnpm preview` servers and set `PLAYWRIGHT_A11Y_SKIP_BUILD=1` after the first build to reuse those processes without rerunning the pretest build.
- `pnpm test --filter shell-web` scopes Vitest to the web shell worker bridge and presentation infrastructure; run this after touching diagnostics or bridge logic so the issue #255 coverage stays green.
- On fresh Linux environments you might need to install Playwright system dependencies once via `pnpm exec playwright install-deps`.
- Vitest suites inherit the shared `@idle-engine/config-vitest` defaults, which now include `vitest-llm-reporter` with streaming disabled. Each run prints a JSON summary block at the end of the output so AI agents and CI jobs can parse results without scraping console text.
- `pnpm coverage:md` runs coverage-enabled Vitest suites for every package and writes `docs/coverage/index.md`. This file is generated by CI and is not tracked in git; to preview locally, run the command and open the file. For consistent results with CI, run `nvm use` before generating coverage.

## Content Validation & Generation
- `pnpm generate` now runs content validation before the compiler writes artifacts. Schema failures stop the pipeline immediately, so fix validation errors before retrying or the downstream artifacts will remain stale.
- Structured JSON logs (`content_pack.validated`, `content_pack.compiled`, `content_pack.validation_failed`, `watch.run`, etc.) stream to stdout. Use `--pretty` only when you want human-readable formatting; automation should consume the default JSON lines.
- Run `pnpm generate --check` (used by CI and Lefthook) to detect drift without rewriting artifacts. The command exits with code `1` when `content/compiled/` or manifest outputs would change, or when validation persists failure summaries.
- `pnpm generate --watch` keeps the validator/compiler pipeline running against content changes. Each iteration emits a `watch.run` summary describing duration, triggers, and outcome while leaving the process alive after failures.
- `content/compiled/index.json` is the canonical workspace summary. Consumers should always read this file (or override `--summary`) and treat it as stale if you skipped validation or the CLI reported failures—rerun `pnpm generate` to refresh it before consuming compiled artifacts.

## Headless Diagnostics (Tick Simulator)

Run a deterministic simulation of the runtime and emit diagnostics JSON:

```
pnpm core:tick-sim --ticks 1000 --step-ms 100 --fail-on-slow --queue-backlog-cap 0
```

Options:
- `--ticks <n>`: Number of ticks to execute (required)
- `--step-ms <ms>`: Fixed step duration (default 100)
- `--max-steps-per-frame <n>`: Clamp steps per frame (default 50)
- `--fail-on-slow`: Exit non-zero if any tick exceeds the configured budget
- `--queue-backlog-cap <n>`: Exit non-zero if queue backlog exceeds `n`
