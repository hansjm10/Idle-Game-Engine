# Resource State Storage Design

**Issue:** #7  
**Workstream:** Runtime Core  
**Status:** Design  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12

> This document defines the struct-of-arrays resource storage that anchors the
> runtime state model described in `docs/idle-engine-design.md` §9.2. The design
> focuses on deterministic updates, cache-friendly iteration, and snapshot
> ergonomics so downstream systems (production, upgrades, offline catch-up, UI
> diffing) can evolve without revisiting the underlying layout.

## 1. Overview

Issue #7 tracks the initial `ResourceState` container responsible for storing
all mutable resource quantities at runtime. The storage must support
deterministic mutation through commands and systems, efficient aggregation for
per-frame calculations, and inexpensive snapshots for UI consumption and save
serialization. A data-oriented, struct-of-arrays layout keeps iteration costs
bounded as content packs scale and aligns with the performance strategy in
`docs/idle-engine-design.md` §12.

## 2. Goals

- **Deterministic mutations:** All adjustments flow through typed helpers that
  enforce caps, prevent negative balances, and emit telemetry on violations.
- **Struct-of-arrays layout:** Store resource attributes in typed arrays to
  minimize cache misses during systems iteration and to simplify snapshotting.
- **Stable indexing:** Provide a canonical resource index map shared by systems,
  command handlers, and serialization so lookups remain O(1).
- **Incremental deltas:** Track per-tick changes so the runtime can publish
  minimal deltas to the presentation shell and replay logs.
- **Persistence-ready:** Expose immutable snapshots compatible with the existing
  `CommandRecorder` structured clone workflow for deterministic save/restore.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Implementing generator logic, upgrade modifiers, or automation scheduling.
- Designing the content pipeline that emits resource/generator definitions.
- Persisting save data to disk (handled by the snapshot and migration workstream).
- Rendering UI views or formatting resource values for presentation.
- Optimizing for multi-threaded mutation; the runtime remains single-threaded.

## 4. Current State

- `packages/core` exposes `setGameState`/`getGameState` helpers
  (`packages/core/src/runtime-state.ts`) but lacks an opinionated resource
  container.
- Commands targeting resources (`COLLECT_RESOURCE`, `PURCHASE_GENERATOR`) are
  defined but have no backing storage APIs.
- No snapshot contract exists for resource quantities; UI and persistence cannot
  consume structured deltas.
- Prior design docs commit to struct-of-arrays (`docs/idle-engine-design.md`
  §9.2) yet no implementation details exist.

## 5. Proposed Solution

### 5.1 Data Layout

Introduce a `ResourceStateBuffers` struct encapsulating the underlying
ArrayBuffers and typed arrays:

```ts
interface ResourcePublishBuffers {
  readonly amounts: Float64Array;
  readonly capacities: Float64Array;
  readonly incomePerSecond: Float64Array;
  readonly expensePerSecond: Float64Array;
  readonly netPerSecond: Float64Array;
  readonly tickDelta: Float64Array;
  readonly flags: Uint8Array;
  readonly dirtyTolerance: Float64Array;
  readonly dirtyIndices: Uint32Array;
  dirtyCount: number;
}

interface ResourceStateBuffers {
  readonly ids: readonly string[];
  readonly indexById: ImmutableMapSnapshot<string, number>;

  // Live, mutating views
  readonly amounts: Float64Array;
  readonly capacities: Float64Array;
  readonly incomePerSecond: Float64Array;
  readonly expensePerSecond: Float64Array;
  readonly netPerSecond: Float64Array;
  readonly tickDelta: Float64Array;
  readonly flags: Uint8Array;
  readonly dirtyTolerance: Float64Array;

  // Double-buffered publish views (ping-pong)
  readonly publish: readonly [ResourcePublishBuffers, ResourcePublishBuffers];

  readonly dirtyIndexScratch: Uint32Array;
  readonly dirtyIndexPositions: Int32Array;
}
```

- `ids`: canonical resource ordering derived from the active content pack.
- `indexById`: `ImmutableMapSnapshot` for O(1) lookup that throws on any attempt
  to mutate it post-initialization.
- `amounts`: current balances (double precision for cumulative accuracy).
- `capacities`: hard caps enforced on mutation; populated from definitions and
  upgrade modifiers.
- `incomePerSecond` / `expensePerSecond`: running totals populated by systems
  each tick to support production diagnostics and UI stat panels. These values
  are mirrored into the publish buffers before `resetPerTickAccumulators` clears
  the live arrays so rate changes survive the publish/reset cycle.
- `netPerSecond`: derived buffer updated at the end of each tick to avoid
  recomputing `income - expense` during reads.
- `tickDelta`: tracks the signed delta applied during the current tick, enabling
  compact state diffs for the presentation layer and recorder.
- `flags`: bit field storing boolean metadata. Bits are allocated as
  `VISIBLE = 1 << 0`, `UNLOCKED = 1 << 1`, and `DIRTY_THIS_TICK = 1 << 2`.
  Mutation helpers set the dirty bit only when they apply a substantive change
  (amount, capacity, visibility, or net rates). Follow-up operations that restore
  parity with the published state clear the bit via `unmarkIfClean`, keeping the
  dirty list minimal heading into publish.
- `dirtyTolerance`: per-resource tolerance ceiling (defaults to
  `DIRTY_EPSILON_CEILING`). When a resource definition supplies
  `dirtyTolerance`, the factory writes the normalized value (clamped to
  `>= DIRTY_EPSILON_ABSOLUTE` and `<= DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX`) into this buffer
  and `epsilonEquals` reads it instead of the default ceiling so prestige-scale
  resources can relax their tolerance without mutating global constants. The
  runtime treats these tolerances as immutable metadata outside initialization,
  hydration, or content reload flows, so dirty tracking deliberately ignores the
  field during per-tick mutation.
- `publish`: pair of `ResourcePublishBuffers` used in a ping-pong pattern. Each
  buffer owns read-only copies of amounts, caps, per-second diagnostics,
  deltas, flags, tolerance ceilings, and the filtered list of dirty indices that back the most
  recent snapshot. `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` writes into the inactive
  publish buffer and then flips the active pointer. Because only two publish
  buffers exist, the previous snapshot (the one created immediately before the
  current publish) remains isolated, but snapshots retained for more than one
  publish must deep-clone their data if they need to remain immutable. To keep
  clean resources aligned when buffers swap without replaying the entire buffer,
  the publish path replays the prior frame's dirty indices into the inactive
  buffer before applying the new tick's updates. The steps are:
  1. Zero `targetPublish.tickDelta` only for indices recorded in either the
     previous publish's dirty list or the current tick's scratch union
     (see §5.5) to avoid `O(resourceCount)` work when the dirty set is small.
  2. Iterate the prefix of `sourcePublish.dirtyIndices` up to
     `sourcePublish.dirtyCount` and copy the corresponding slots (amounts, caps,
     rates, flags, tolerance) from `sourcePublish` into the inactive buffer so
     everything that moved last tick is already correct while leaving
     `tickDelta` at zero.
  3. Apply the current tick's dirty updates (see §5.5).
  Resources that stay clean for two consecutive ticks never move, keeping the
  copy cost proportional to the union of the previous and current dirty sets
  instead of `O(resourceCount)`. Each publish buffer maintains a mutable
  `dirtyCount` that records how much of its `dirtyIndices` array is populated;
  the snapshot path zeroes this value before repopulating the list for the
  current tick.
- `dirtyIndexScratch`: reusable scratch space sized to `resourceCount`. The data
  structure stores a compact list of mutated indices during the tick without
  allocating new arrays.
- `dirtyIndexPositions`: `Int32Array` mapping resource index → position inside
  the scratch prefix (or `-1` when absent). `markDirty` and `unmarkIfClean`
  consult this map to append and remove indices in O(1) while keeping the prefix
  densely packed. During publish passes the map may temporarily hold the sentinel
  value `-2` (`SCRATCH_VISITED`) while unioned loops are running; the loop restores
  the entry to `-1` before exiting so steady-state semantics remain unchanged.
- `definitionDigest`: frozen record `{ ids, version, hash }` cached alongside the
  immutable id array so save systems can quickly confirm compatibility prior to
  hydration.

```ts
interface ResourceDefinitionDigest {
  readonly ids: readonly string[];
  readonly version: number;
  readonly hash: string;
}
```

All live numeric buffers share a single `ArrayBuffer` per numeric width to
improve serialization locality while keeping independent views disjoint. The
Float64 views (`amounts`, `capacities`, `incomePerSecond`, `expensePerSecond`,
`netPerSecond`, `tickDelta`, `dirtyTolerance`) are carved out of a backing buffer
sized as `Float64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT * 7 * resourceCount`. Each publish
buffer owns its own Float64 `ArrayBuffer` sized for the copied views (covering
all seven slices) so the runtime can flip
  between `publish[0]` and `publish[1]` without invalidating previously issued
  snapshots. Typed arrays are constructed with an offset stride where
  `stride = resourceCount * Float64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`
  (`amounts` at offset `0`, `capacities` at `1 * stride`, etc.). The scratch and
position maps use dedicated `ArrayBuffer`s, as do the Uint8 flag bits for both
live and publish views.

Comparisons between live and publish buffers run through
`epsilonEquals(a, b)`, which treats two values as equivalent when

```
const magnitude = Math.max(Math.abs(a), Math.abs(b));
const tolerance = Math.max(
  DIRTY_EPSILON_ABSOLUTE,
  Math.min(toleranceCeiling, DIRTY_EPSILON_RELATIVE * magnitude),
);
return Math.abs(a - b) <= tolerance;
```

Comparisons short-circuit when operands are already identical (including
matching `Infinity` sentinels) so resources that return to their prior state do
not remain marked dirty after reconciliation.

`toleranceCeiling` resolves per resource from the mutable `dirtyTolerance`
buffer (defaulting to `DIRTY_EPSILON_CEILING` but allowed to grow up to
`DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX`), ensuring the epsilon never exceeds the ceiling
stored for that index.

Default constants:

- `DIRTY_EPSILON_ABSOLUTE = 1e-9` collapses near-zero jitter.
- `DIRTY_EPSILON_RELATIVE = 1e-9` scales tolerance in proportion to value size.
- `DIRTY_EPSILON_CEILING = 1e-3` serves as the default per-resource ceiling.
- `DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX = 5e-1` bounds definition-supplied overrides so they
  can relax tolerance for prestige-scale resources without letting massive deltas
  slip through unchecked while still covering magnitude ranges up to
  approximately `1e15` without keeping resources perpetually dirty.

If specific resources require looser tolerances (e.g., prestige currencies with
huge exponential growth), the content definition may optionally supply a
`dirtyTolerance` override that the factory stores alongside the resource index;
`epsilonEquals` then reads the per-resource ceiling (capped only by
`DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX`). Telemetry records the raw comparisons whenever the
override saturates so balancing can adjust the configuration before release.
When this occurs the runtime emits `ResourceDirtyToleranceSaturated` with
`{ resourceId, field, difference, toleranceCeiling, relativeTolerance, magnitude }`
so analytics and balancing pipelines have the full context.

`ImmutableMapSnapshot` is already provided by `packages/core/src/immutable-snapshots.ts`
and proxies mutation methods so the lookup table cannot be altered after the
state is created.

### 5.2 Runtime API Surface

Expose a `ResourceState` façade that owns the buffers internally while providing
mutation and query helpers:

```ts
interface ResourceState {
  getIndex(id: string): number | undefined;
  requireIndex(id: string): number;
  getAmount(index: number): number;
  getCapacity(index: number): number;
  getNetPerSecond(index: number): number;
  isUnlocked(index: number): boolean;
  isVisible(index: number): boolean;
  grantVisibility(index: number): void;
  unlock(index: number): void;
  setCapacity(index: number, capacity: number): number;
  addAmount(index: number, amount: number): number;
  spendAmount(
    index: number,
    amount: number,
    context?: ResourceSpendAttemptContext,
  ): boolean;
  applyIncome(index: number, amountPerSecond: number): void;
  applyExpense(index: number, amountPerSecond: number): void;
  finalizeTick(deltaMs: number): void;
  resetPerTickAccumulators(): void;
  forceClearDirtyState(): void;
  clearDirtyScratch(): void;
  snapshot(options?: { mode?: 'publish' | 'recorder' }): ResourceStateSnapshot;
  exportForSave(): SerializedResourceState;
  getDefinitionDigest(): ResourceDefinitionDigest;
}
```

- The module retains the `ResourceStateBuffers` reference inside a closure so
  external callers can only mutate state through the façade. Instrumentation or
  diagnostics that need raw access live in the same module and never receive a
  public reference to the mutable typed arrays.
- Mutation helpers return the actual delta applied to support downstream
  bookkeeping.
- `requireIndex(id)` wraps `getIndex` with an invariant check that throws and
  emits telemetry when presented with an unknown id. Index-based helpers call
  an internal `assertValidIndex(index)` guard so typed arrays never absorb
  silent out-of-bounds writes.
  - A private `markDirty(index: number)` helper ensures each index is tracked only
    once per tick. It consults the `DIRTY_THIS_TICK` bit and `dirtyIndexPositions`
    map before pushing into the scratch prefix, then records the assigned slot so
    future checks stay O(1). Every entry in `dirtyIndexPositions` is initialized to
    `-1`; the first call to `markDirty` writes the index into `dirtyIndexScratch`
    at position `dirtyIndexCount`, persists that position inside the map, and
    increments the count. The helper is invoked only after confirming the live
    state and the active publish buffer fail `epsilonEquals` for any tracked field
    (amount, capacity, income, expense, net, or flags). If a later mutation
    restores parity and `epsilonEquals` returns true again, `unmarkIfClean(index)`
    reads the stored slot, swaps the tail entry into place, updates both impacted
    `dirtyIndexPositions` entries (the restored index and the swapped tail), clears
    the dirty bit, and writes `-1` back into the map. The publish pass introduces a
    second sentinel (`SCRATCH_VISITED = -2`) while it performs unioned work over
    previous/current dirty sets, then restores the map to `-1` afterward. Zero-delta
    work therefore never leaks into the publish pipeline and the scratch prefix
    always remains densely packed without allocations.
  - To prevent callers from skipping the epsilon/dirty bookkeeping, every façade
  helper routes writes through `updateFloatField(index, field, nextValue)` and
  `updateFlagField(index, mask, shouldSet)` utilities defined inside the module.
  These helpers centralize the `epsilonEquals` comparison, dirty bit toggling,
  and `dirtyIndexPositions` maintenance so individual mutators cannot drift out
  of sync.
- Internal maintenance code uses `writeAmountDirect(index, amount)` to bypass
  capacity clamping during save restore or migrations. The helper is not part of
  the public façade and is only callable from privileged modules in the same
  file so gameplay code must go through `addAmount`. For tooling, the module
  exposes an opt-in escape hatch `__unsafeWriteAmountDirect(state, index, amount)`
  that routes through the same helper; callers are expected to guard their inputs
  and remain confined to hydration/migration flows.
  - `finalizeTick(deltaMs)` converts accumulated per-second rates into a proposed
    delta, clamps amounts to capacities/zero, recomputes `netPerSecond`, and relies
    on `markDirty` + `unmarkIfClean` to ensure only indices with meaningful
    divergence remain dirty at the end of the tick (cancelling incomes/expenses do
    not surface spurious deltas). The conversion uses
    `deltaSeconds = deltaMs / 1_000`, computes `incomeDelta =
    incomePerSecond * deltaSeconds`, `expenseDelta = expensePerSecond * deltaSeconds`,
    and derives a tentative `appliedDelta = incomeDelta - expenseDelta`. After
    clamping the live amount into `[0, capacity]`, we recompute the
    `actualDelta = clampedAmount - previousAmount` and calculate
    `nextTickDelta = tickDelta[index] + actualDelta`. When `epsilonEquals(nextTickDelta, 0)`
    succeeds we reset `tickDelta[index] = 0`; otherwise we assign the computed
    `nextTickDelta`. We never clear an existing non-zero `tickDelta` unless the
    combined value reconciles to ~0 so earlier frame work (e.g., capacity adjustments
    or direct grants) survives the finalize pass. Dirty bookkeeping and telemetry
    always use `actualDelta` so resources that hit their cap/zero do not remain in
    the dirty set indefinitely. Callers must pass a finite, non-negative `deltaMs`;
    otherwise telemetry emits `ResourceFinalizeInvalidDelta` and the helper throws
    before mutating any buffers, preventing clock drift or `NaN` propagation from
    corrupting state.
- `resetPerTickAccumulators()` clears the live `incomePerSecond`,
  `expensePerSecond`, and `tickDelta` arrays after publish while leaving the
  publish buffers untouched thanks to the ping-pong double buffering. It does
  **not** zero `netPerSecond`; that value remains valid until the next
  `finalizeTick` so systems sampling immediately after publish observe the most
  recent rates. The helper asserts that `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` has already
  executed during the current tick (tracked via an internal boolean toggled by the
  snapshot path); calling it out of order throws and logs telemetry because clearing
  the accumulators before publish would erase the tick delta that the UI expects to
  consume.
- `clearDirtyScratch()` clears residual dirty metadata and associated flag bits
  after authoritative calls to `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` complete (the
  snapshot path itself resets the scratch length to zero). For rare flows that
  intentionally skip publish (e.g. deterministic test harnesses comparing
  recorder snapshots) the module exposes `forceClearDirtyState()` which performs
  the same scratch reset *and* clears `incomePerSecond`, `expensePerSecond`, and
  `tickDelta` under an internal "publish skipped" guard. Callers must invoke
  `forceClearDirtyState()` instead of `resetPerTickAccumulators()` in that
  scenario so rate accumulators do not desynchronise. Production code relies on
  `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` instead of calling either helper directly.
- `getDefinitionDigest()` returns the frozen `{ ids, version, hash }` payload
  recorded during initialization so save serializers can embed it and hydration
  routines can check compatibility before replaying data.
- `snapshot(options)` defaults to `{ mode: 'publish' }`. Callers opt into
  recorder mode explicitly so accidental captures do not skip the publish reset.

The façade tracks the active length in a `dirtyIndexCount` field; the valid
portion of `dirtyIndexScratch` lives in `[0, dirtyIndexCount)`. Mutations append
indices only when the dirty bit transitions from clear to set, guaranteeing that
each index appears at most once per tick without extra allocations. Whenever
the list changes, `dirtyIndexPositions` keeps the index ↔ position mapping in
sync so removals and parity-driven unmarks stay constant time even in the hot
path.

### 5.3 Initialization & Lifecycle

Provide a factory `createResourceState(defs: readonly ResourceDefinition[])`
that:

1. Validates incoming definitions without reordering so designer-authored order
   is preserved and surfaces deterministically in presentation. The content pack
   compiler guarantees a stable array order; the factory verifies uniqueness by
   inserting ids into a `Set` and throws on duplicates.
2. Allocates typed arrays sized to the resource count. Initialization passes
   each definition through `sanitizeInitialResourceValues`, which clamps
   `startAmount` into `[0, capacity]`, rejects `NaN`/non-finite input with a
   telemetry event and thrown error, and logs + clamps negative values to `0` or
   overshoot values down to the capacity. The sanitized amounts populate both
   the live `amounts` array and the mirrored publish buffers. Capacities default
   to `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` when unspecified (and populate both publish
   views) so the initial snapshot requires no additional copying. The retainers
   track the active publish buffer index (`0` at bootstrap) and mark the standby
   buffer ready for the next tick, clearing each publish buffer's `dirtyCount` to
   `0`. The save serializer treats `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` as `null` to avoid
   lossy JSON round-trips.
3. Initializes `flags` with `VISIBLE | UNLOCKED` for starting resources and
   zero for locked ones.
4. Populates `dirtyTolerance[index]` with the sanitized tolerance from the
   definition (if provided) or `DIRTY_EPSILON_CEILING`. Sanitization clamps the
   tolerance between `DIRTY_EPSILON_ABSOLUTE` and `DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX`, and
   each publish buffer stores the same scalar so comparison logic receives a
   per-resource ceiling regardless of which buffer is active. Overrides that land
   above the default ceiling but within the max let prestige-scale resources relax
   their noise floor deterministically.
5. Wraps `ids` in `Object.freeze` and converts the `indexById` lookup table into
   an `ImmutableMapSnapshot` via the existing `enforceImmutable(...)` helper so
   any attempt to mutate it throws at runtime.
6. Seeds the `dirtyIndexScratch` array with a sentinel length counter of `0`
   (tracked separately inside the façade) and fills `dirtyIndexPositions` with
   `-1` so the first mutation appends in-place without additional setup.
7. Emits a `ResourceDefinitionDigest` record `{ ids, version, hash }` so save
   restores can verify content compatibility before hydrating. When hydrating a
   save the runtime invokes `reconcileSaveAgainstDefinitions(savedIds, defs)`
   which produces a mapping from save index → live index, reports removed/added
   ids, and throws if a referenced id no longer exists. Mismatches surface
   telemetry (`ResourceHydrationMismatch`) and fail fast instead of silently
   dropping data; future migrations can hook into this reconciliation step to map
   old ids onto new ones.

  On content reload or save restore, callers reuse the factory with definitions
  and then hydrate numeric buffers from persisted data. `reconcileSaveAgainstDefinitions`
  drives the process: it verifies payload array lengths, produces a remapping from
  save indices to live indices, and rejects any out-of-band data. Hydration iterates
  the remapping, writes restored amount/capacity values and flag bits into both the
  live and publish typed arrays, zeros `incomePerSecond`, `expensePerSecond`,
  `netPerSecond`, and `tickDelta` in both views, and clears the dirty scratch counter
  so the next `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` immediately reflects the restored state
  without forcing a full-tick recomputation. Until the first post-restore tick runs
  the UI should expect rate diagnostics to read as zero; the follow-up finalize
  recomputes rates deterministically. The runtime stores the `ResourceState` inside
  the broader game state object managed by `setGameState(...)`; systems recompute
  per-second rates on the very next tick using the hydrated amounts. Save restore and
  migration utilities invoke the internal `writeAmountDirect` helper during this
  process so they can place values that temporarily exceed caps before the relevant
  upgrades reapply. Immediately after hydration the engine reapplies content-defined
  capacities/upgrades and only then schedules the next `finalizeTick`. This ordering
  ensures overshoot values survive long enough for upgrade modifiers to recreate the
  higher caps; if no modifier reinstates a wider cap before finalize executes, the
  clamp (and corresponding telemetry) makes the data loss explicit to designers.

### 5.4 Mutation Semantics

- **Additions:** `addAmount` increases `amounts[index]` while always clamping to
  capacity. Negative input throws to catch misuse; callers use `spendAmount` for
  decrements. If the applied delta resolves to zero (e.g. already at cap or the
  caller adds `0`), the helper returns `0` and avoids calling `markDirty`. When
  the applied delta is non-zero, it accumulates into `tickDelta[index]` and
  `markDirty` tracks the index exactly once for the tick. Internal maintenance
  utilities (migrations, save restore) use a private `writeAmountDirect` helper
  that bypasses the clamp, never the public façade, so gameplay code cannot
  accidentally overshoot capacities.
- **Spending:** `spendAmount` verifies `amounts[index] >= amount` before
  subtracting. It returns `true/false` to signal insufficient resources and
  never allows negative balances. Successful spends subtract from both
  `amounts[index]` and `tickDelta[index]`, then call `markDirty`. If the spend
  later gets cancelled by a compensating `addAmount` before publish, the helper
  calls `unmarkIfClean` once the live values satisfy `epsilonEquals` with the
  publish buffer, dropping the index from the scratch list. When spending fails,
  telemetry records a `ResourceSpendFailed` event with the offending
  command/system id (when supplied via `ResourceSpendAttemptContext`) and the guard throws if the caller attempts to subtract a
  negative amount.
- **Per-second accumulation:** Systems call `applyIncome` / `applyExpense`
  during their tick. Inputs must be finite (`Number.isFinite`) and non-negative;
  attempts to submit negative, `NaN`, or infinite rates log telemetry and throw.
  Each helper adds to (`+=`) `incomePerSecond[index]` and
  `expensePerSecond[index]`, allowing multiple systems to compose within a
  single frame. Helpers ignore zero-valued inputs and mark the resource dirty
  only when the accumulator fails `epsilonEquals` against the most recent
  publish buffer. If opposing calls cancel each other within the same tick,
  `unmarkIfClean` clears the dirty flag once the accumulators drift back inside
  the epsilon band and the previously published buffer retains the prior rates.
- **Capacity updates:** `setCapacity` validates the requested capacity (must be
  `>= 0`, not `NaN`; `Infinity` is permitted to represent uncapped resources)
  before writing into the buffer. Invalid values log telemetry and throw. On
  success the helper clamps the current amount if it now exceeds the cap
  (recording that clamp as a delta in `tickDelta`), calls `markDirty`, and
  returns the applied cap so command handlers can publish diffs. The subsequent
  publish copies the new cap into the active publish buffer.
- **Visibility/unlock:** `grantVisibility` and `unlock` set bits inside the
  flag buffer and mark the resource dirty so the UI is notified.

Dirty tracking (flag bit `0b100`) is cleared inside `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })`
only after the live values and flag bits have been copied into the publish
buffers. The same loop clears the bit in both the live flag array (so subsequent
mutations have to re-mark the resource) and the publish copy (by masking the bit
before exposure). Clearing the bit at this point keeps the underlying live
buffers mutable while guaranteeing the published snapshot remains immutable.

Every index-based helper calls `assertValidIndex(index)`, which verifies
`index >= 0 && index < resourceCount`, logs a `ResourceIndexViolation` telemetry
event, and throws when the guard fails. Command handlers invoke `requireIndex`
so the guard fires at lookup time rather than after a mutation attempt.

### 5.5 Snapshot & Persistence

- `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` returns a *read-only-by-contract* view
    (`ResourceStateSnapshot`) containing:
      - `ids` (frozen array).
      - Direct references to the publish buffer's typed arrays. To keep cache-friendly
        hot reads intact we still hand out the live views, but the runtime installs a
        lightweight `createImmutableTypedArrayView(...)` wrapper over each view in
        non-production builds. The wrapper traps mutators, forwards safe reads, and
        throws when a consumer attempts to write. Production builds may disable the
        guard by clearing `SNAPSHOT_GUARDS`, but tests and development builds force it
        on by default so accidental mutations cannot corrupt determinism. The flag now
        supports three modes: `'auto'` (default; enabled for `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`),
        `'force-on'`, and `'force-off'`, giving automation harnesses explicit control.
        Guarded views share their backing buffer with the publish arrays so the check
        costs a single proxy allocation per field rather than deep cloning; structured
        cloning paths use recorder mode instead.
      - The typed arrays surface only to same-thread consumers. Cross-thread transport
        happens through the `ResourcePublishTransport` (see below); attempting to
        `postMessage` a `ResourceStateSnapshot` is unsupported and intentionally
        undocumented in the runtime API.
      - A compact list of dirty indices for the current tick. Consumers read the
        shared `Uint32Array` prefix `[0, dirtyCount)` and must ignore unused
        capacity beyond that point; the array remains read-only by contract just
        like the other typed views.
      - Flag bits encoded as a read-only `Uint8Array` snapshot sourced from
        `targetPublish.flags`.
    The publish snapshot type is therefore:

    ```ts
    interface ResourceStateSnapshot {
      readonly ids: readonly string[];
      readonly amounts: Float64Array;
      readonly capacities: Float64Array;
      readonly incomePerSecond: Float64Array;
      readonly expensePerSecond: Float64Array;
      readonly netPerSecond: Float64Array;
      readonly tickDelta: Float64Array;
      readonly flags: Uint8Array;
      readonly dirtyTolerance: Float64Array;
      readonly dirtyIndices: Uint32Array;
      readonly dirtyCount: number;
    }
    ```
    The TypeScript surface marks these arrays as `readonly` to call out the contract.
    In `'auto'`/`'force-on'` guard modes the runtime swaps each typed array reference
    for the immutable proxy returned by `createImmutableTypedArrayView(...)`, keeping
    the same underlying buffer while disallowing writes in development and test
    environments. Recorder mode returns the same interface, but the arrays are
    deep-cloned and own their backing buffers regardless of guard configuration so
    structured cloning cannot observe shared state.
- `snapshot({ mode: 'recorder' })` returns the same shape but clones its data
  into ephemeral typed arrays owned by the recorder call site (amount, capacity,
  income, expense, net, tick delta, flags, tolerance). This mode does not touch dirty
  bookkeeping, publish mirrors, or per-tick accumulators, allowing
  pre/post-command captures without interfering with the presentation pipeline.
  The full-clone approach is `O(resourceCount)` per capture; for now we accept the
  overhead because command executions are infrequent in deterministic tests. If the
  workload proves heavier, future work can explore reusing the inactive publish
  buffer with reference counting or capturing only the dirty indices plus a shared
  frozen baseline.
  Recorder-mode clones remain structured-clone friendly, so tooling can persist
  them or ship them across worker boundaries without additional conversion.
- `exportForSave()` returns a POJO suitable for persistence:

```ts
interface SerializedResourceState {
  readonly ids: readonly string[];
  readonly amounts: readonly number[];
  readonly capacities: readonly (number | null)[];
  readonly unlocked?: readonly boolean[];
  readonly visible?: readonly boolean[];
  readonly flags: readonly number[];
}

interface ResourceSpendAttemptContext {
  readonly commandId?: string;
  readonly systemId?: string;
}
```

Offline catch-up consumes `SerializedResourceState`, rehydrates the live typed
arrays, and continues deterministic execution. The save payload intentionally
omits per-second income/expense data because they are tick-scoped diagnostics;
the runtime zeros those buffers (both live and publish views) on restore and
regenerates fresh rates during the next tick.

  `flags` mirrors the raw bit mask so future toggle bits survive round-trips even
  when older clients do not understand them. The optional `unlocked` and
  `visible` arrays remain for ergonomic access in content tooling; when provided
  they must stay in sync with the bit mask. `reconcileSaveAgainstDefinitions`
  validates that every array matches the `ids.length` (`flags.length` must also
  match) and throws `ResourceSaveLengthMismatch` when they do not; telemetry
  captures the offending metadata. During rehydration the module trusts `flags`
  as the single source of truth, rebuilding the convenience arrays from the mask
  so the emitted snapshot always reflects the authoritative bits.

Consumers should continue to respect the dirty index list when emitting deltas,
 and because the publish path zeros `targetPublish.tickDelta` only for the
 explicitly dirty candidates (step 1 below), a resource that resolves to clean
 state never exposes a stale delta. Comparisons reuse the shared `epsilonEquals`
 helper, meaning near-zero
differences neither propagate into the publish buffer nor keep indices marked
dirty.

During `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` the runtime selects the inactive publish
buffer (`targetPublish`) and records the current active buffer as
`sourcePublish`. Rather than cloning the entire snapshot, the runtime reapplies
just the slots that may have diverged while `targetPublish` sat idle:
  1. Visit the prior publish's dirty list and the current tick's scratch prefix
     in turn, zeroing `targetPublish.tickDelta` for each unique index. We reuse
     `dirtyIndexPositions` to skip duplicates: before the pass we write a sentinel
     (`SCRATCH_VISITED = -2`) into `dirtyIndexPositions[index]` for every index we
     touch, and we skip further work whenever an index already equals that sentinel.
     After the pass the loop restores `dirtyIndexPositions[index] = -1`, so the map
     is ready for the copy stage without allocating additional sets or arrays. No
     concatenation or temporary buffers are required and the work remains
     proportional to the dirty set.
  2. Compute `previousDirtyCount = sourcePublish.dirtyCount` and iterate the
     prefix `sourcePublish.dirtyIndices[0..previousDirtyCount)`, copying the
     corresponding amount/capacity/rate/flag entries from `sourcePublish` into
     `targetPublish` while leaving their `tickDelta` at zero. This guarantees the
     inactive buffer matches the authoritative snapshot for everything that
     changed last tick.
  3. Reset `targetPublish.dirtyCount = 0` and capture the current
     `dirtyIndexCount` into a local `scratchCount`; the scratch array contents
     remain intact until the loop finishes.
  4. Iterate the first `scratchCount` entries in `dirtyIndexScratch`, compare each
     candidate against `sourcePublish` using the epsilon test (§5.2), and write the
     live values (amount, capacity, income, expense, net, tick delta, flags,
     tolerance) into `targetPublish` when they diverge. `dirtyTolerance` only changes
     during initialization, hydration, or content reload flows; the tick loop never
     mutates it, so the comparison normally short-circuits unless a tooling action
     explicitly updates the buffer. The flag copy masks out the engine-only
     `DIRTY_THIS_TICK` bit so consumers never observe internal bookkeeping. Slots that
     converge leave the live `tickDelta` untouched so recorder snapshots captured
     immediately after publish still observe the accumulated delta; they simply skip
     the dirty list. `resetPerTickAccumulators()` (or `forceClearDirtyState()`) remains
     responsible for clearing the live accumulator once consumers finish reading it.

For each surviving index we write it into
`targetPublish.dirtyIndices[targetPublish.dirtyCount++]` and mark
`dirtyIndexPositions[index] = -1` so the next tick appends from a clean slate.
After the loop the runtime flips `activePublishIndex`, exposes the read-only
views, sets `dirtyIndexCount = 0`, and walks both the `previousDirtyCount` and
`scratchCount` ranges to ensure every corresponding `dirtyIndexPositions` entry
is `-1` (debug builds may also zero the scratch slots for readability). Because
consumers read from the now-active publish buffer only, later mutations operate
on the live arrays and the alternate publish buffer without affecting the
snapshot in circulation. `clearDirtyScratch()` remains an escape hatch for test
harnesses that need to force-reset live buffers without emitting a snapshot.

### 5.6 Integration Points

- **Command handlers:** `COLLECT_RESOURCE` routes through `addAmount`,
  `PURCHASE_GENERATOR` and future `APPLY_MODIFIER` commands use `spendAmount`
  and `setCapacity`. All handlers include resource ids to translate into indices
  via `requireIndex`, ensuring invalid content references surface as telemetry.
- **Systems:** Production, automation, and prestige systems receive the shared
  `ResourceState` instance on registration. Each system operates on indices
  rather than ids for tight loops; helper utilities resolve ids only during
  initialization.
- **Telemetry:** The resource module records events via the existing
  `telemetry` facade (`TelemetryEventData`) for invalid operations, capacity
  clamping, overflow detection, and comparisons that saturate a resource's dirty
  tolerance ceiling. Metrics aggregate per-second income/expense totals for
  diagnostics dashboards.
- **Presentation bridge:** When publishing state to the UI, the runtime emits
    either the full snapshot (initial load) or a delta referencing dirty indices
    with updated `amount`, `capacity`, per-second rates, `netPerSecond`, and
    `visibility` flags. Before calling `worker.postMessage` the bridge converts
    the immutable typed-array views into a `ResourcePublishTransport` built from
    a pooled set of transferable slabs sized exactly to `dirtyCount`. Each field
    is copied with a tight `Float64Array`/`Uint8Array` whose length equals the
    number of dirty indices, meaning the transport cost grows with the delta
    rather than `resourceCount`. Slabs come from a `TransportBufferPool` so the
    runtime reuses `ArrayBuffer`s across frames; the pool guarantees buffers are
    detached only after the worker acknowledges receipt.
    The transport contract is versioned (`version: 2`) and self-describing:

    ```ts
    type TransportComponent =
      | 'amounts'
      | 'capacities'
      | 'incomePerSecond'
      | 'expensePerSecond'
      | 'netPerSecond'
      | 'tickDelta'
      | 'flags'
      | 'dirtyTolerance';

    interface TransportBufferDescriptor {
      readonly component: TransportComponent;
      readonly ctor: 'Float64Array' | 'Uint8Array';
      readonly buffer: ArrayBuffer;
      readonly byteOffset: number;
      readonly length: number;
    }

    interface ResourcePublishTransport {
      readonly version: 2;
      readonly ids: readonly string[];
      readonly dirtyIndices: Uint32Array;
      readonly buffers: readonly TransportBufferDescriptor[];
    }
    ```

    Every descriptor includes the typed-array constructor string, length, and
    byte offset so consumers can rebuild deterministic views without hard-coded
    assumptions. Single-threaded presentation (no worker) still goes through the
    transport builder, but instead of transferring the buffers we hand the pooled
    typed arrays directly to the UI diff routine, keeping the zero-copy path.
- **Command recorder:** The recorder uses `snapshot({ mode: 'recorder' })`
  before/after command execution to capture deterministic replays; this mode
  deep-clones the live view so structured cloning succeeds without disturbing
  the dirty tracking that the presentation layer relies on.

### 5.7 Implementation Plan

1. Scaffold `packages/core/src/resource-state.ts` with the buffer structs,
   factory, and façade.
2. Wire the module into existing exports (`packages/core/src/index.ts`).
3. Add an opt-in snapshot guard helper to `packages/core/src/immutable-snapshots.ts`
   that wraps typed arrays in write-throwing proxies when `SNAPSHOT_GUARDS` is enabled,
   plus tests covering both the fast path (direct views) and the guarded debug path.
4. Implement the pooled buffer transport (`TransportBufferPool`) and bridge
   utilities that build `ResourcePublishTransport` payloads proportional to the
   dirty set, including worker/non-worker code paths and metadata reconstruction.
5. Add reconciliation helpers (`reconcileSaveAgainstDefinitions`, definition
   digest emission) and expose `forceClearDirtyState()` for test-only reset flows.
6. Add Vitest coverage for initialization, mutation semantics, dirty tracking,
   duplicate-id guarding, snapshot generation (including `null` persistence for
   uncapped capacities), income/expense publish mirroring, and rehydration from
   persisted saves. Include cases for per-resource `dirtyTolerance` overrides
   saturating `DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX` and telemetry emission when the cap is
   hit.
7. Update command handlers (future issue) to depend on `ResourceState`.
8. Extend documentation (`docs/runtime-command-queue-design.md`) with references
   to the new storage contract after implementation lands.

## 6. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests verifying:
  - Deterministic preservation of the definition-supplied resource order (stable
    indices when the content array itself is stable).
  - Duplicate ids throw during initialization.
  - Initial amount sanitization clamps into `[0, capacity]`, rejects non-finite
    values with telemetry + throw, and logs whenever a clamp occurs.
  - Capacity enforcement (including accepting `Infinity`) and telemetry emission
    on attempted overflows.
  - Spending failure paths leave balances untouched.
  - `requireIndex` and `assertValidIndex` telemetry + throw on unknown ids or
    out-of-range indices.
  - `finalizeTick` converts rates into clamped deltas given various `deltaMs`
    and suppresses changes whenever `epsilonEquals(appliedDelta, 0)` succeeds.
  - `applyIncome` / `applyExpense` reject negative, `NaN`, or infinite inputs
    with telemetry and throw.
  - `dirtyTolerance` overrides clamp to the allowed range (`DIRTY_EPSILON_ABSOLUTE`
    → `DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX`), influence
    `epsilonEquals`, surface telemetry when ceilings are reached, and round-trip
    through publish/recorder snapshots without allocation churn.
  - Zero-value income/expense submissions, or opposing submissions that land
    within the epsilon band, do not mark resources dirty and rate changes still
    propagate into the publish buffers when `epsilonEquals` fails.
  - `dirtyIndexPositions` keeps tail swaps O(1) and is reset after publish.
- `snapshot({ mode: 'publish' })` resets the dirty scratch counter while leaving
  the published delta accessible and read-only through the double-buffered
  proxies, guaranteeing the snapshot emitted on the previous publish remains
  unchanged and documenting that older snapshots require cloning.
- Immutable snapshot guards throw in development/test builds and can be toggled
  with `SNAPSHOT_GUARDS` in production builds.
- `snapshot({ mode: 'recorder' })` leaves dirty tracking and live buffers
  untouched while returning a deep-clone suitable for structured cloning.
- Dirty index tracking only flags mutated resources per tick.
- Alternating add/spend sequences that mathematically cancel within the
  epsilon drop out of `dirtyIndexScratch` before publish.
- Publish snapshots copy only the union of the previous and current dirty
  indices; clean resources do not trigger full-buffer clones.
- Publish tick deltas are zeroed for indices that revert to their previous
  state before publish.
- `ResourcePublishTransport` payloads only include `dirtyCount` elements per
  field, reuse pooled buffers, and reconstruct correctly on both worker and
  main-thread consumers (including constructor metadata validation).
- `forceClearDirtyState()` clears rate accumulators and scratch metadata without
  requiring a publish, and `resetPerTickAccumulators()` still throws when called
  before publish.
- `exportForSave()` serializes uncapped capacities as `null` and rehydrates to
  `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
- Rehydration from saves updates both live and publish buffers so the first
  publish after restore reflects the persisted values.
- Save reconciliation rejects mismatched ids/lengths and emits telemetry when
  definitions drift.
- Snapshot tests ensuring immutable wrappers block mutation attempts (including
  `.buffer` access and bulk mutators).
- Property-based tests (future follow-up) around additive/subtractive symmetry.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

- **Precision drift & magnitude ceiling:** Using `Float64Array` mitigates
  cumulative rounding error common in idle economies, but values above `2^53`
  lose integer precision. Balance tuning will monitor growth curves and, when
  definitions demand it, graduate to a fixed-point or logarithmic representation
  captured in a follow-up design doc.
- **Serialization cost:** Large typed arrays can inflate save size. Mitigate by
  delta-encoding saves or compressing offline, tracked in a follow-up issue.
- **Publish diff cost:** Each publish now copies only the union of the previous
  and current dirty indices, so typical frames stay proportional to the change
  set. Worst-case churn (everything dirty every tick) degenerates to full-buffer
  copies; telemetry will track publish duration so we can revisit the strategy
  if content packs grow orders of magnitude larger.
- **Content churn:** New resources require reinitialization. Mitigate by
  defining migration utilities that map old saves onto new resource ordering.
- **Future threading needs:** If a separate worker manipulates resources, shared
  buffers would require atomics. Out of scope now; document invariants so future
  work can extend safely.
- **Proxy guard complexity:** Zero-copy typed-array proxies must replicate the
  existing immutability guarantees. The implementation will live alongside the
  existing snapshot utilities and include exhaustive tests for mutator trapping.

## 8. Decisions & Clarifications

- **Prestige currencies:** Prestige and primary currencies share the same
  `ResourceState`. Content packs tag prestige entries in their definitions, and
  the runtime stores that metadata alongside the immutable `ids` array so
  systems can branch without duplicating buffers.
- **Ordering:** Resource definitions keep the order supplied by the content pack.
  The pack compiler owns determinism of that ordering, and the factory validates
  duplicates without re-sorting so design-authored presentation remains intact.
- **Income/expense accumulation:** `applyIncome` / `applyExpense` reset to zero
  each tick via `resetPerTickAccumulators`. Rolling averages are calculated by
  analytics code that consumes successive snapshots instead of mutating the core
  buffers.
- **Telemetry format:** Mutations emit structured telemetry events with
  `{resourceId, operation, amountBefore, amountAfter}` payloads. An optional
  diagnostics system aggregates these into per-second summaries for dashboards
  without coupling the storage layer to presentation concerns.
- **Localized labels:** Snapshots expose resource ids only; UI and localization
  layers resolve display names via the content pack metadata. This avoids sharing
  mutable strings or translation maps across module boundaries.
- **Dirty tolerance configuration:** Content packs may provide an optional
  `dirtyTolerance` per resource; the factory normalizes the value into
  `dirtyTolerance[index]` (clamped only by `DIRTY_EPSILON_OVERRIDE_MAX`), the
  publish buffers mirror it, and telemetry fires when runtime changes push
  comparisons up against the ceiling so designers can right-size the tolerance.
- **Snapshot guard defaults:** `SNAPSHOT_GUARDS='auto'` enables immutable proxies
  in development and test builds automatically; production builds can override to
  `'force-on'` (hardened) or `'force-off'` (maximum throughput).

Additional resolved clarifications:

- The factory rejects duplicate resource ids up front, ensuring deterministic
  indexing.
- The tick loop calls `finalizeTick` after systems finish mutating rates and
  balances, emits a snapshot, and then invokes `resetPerTickAccumulators`
  immediately after the publish so subsequent reads observe cleared per-tick
  state.
- `setCapacity` accepts `Infinity` to re-establish uncapped resources while
  continuing to reject `NaN` and negatives.
- Save rehydration writes values into both live and publish buffers and clears
  dirty scratch state before the next tick processes.
- Publish snapshots ping-pong between two typed-array sets; the runtime reuses
  the buffer that is not currently active, so only the snapshot from the
  previous publish is preserved without copying.
- Dirty index positions reset to `-1` after each publish, preserving O(1)
  removal semantics for the next tick.
- The shared `epsilonEquals` helper (absolute `1e-9`, relative `1e-9`, ceiling
  `1e-3`, optionally overridden per resource) governs all float comparisons
  between live and publish buffers so jitter never keeps resources dirty or
  produces phantom deltas while still detecting meaningful changes at higher
  magnitudes.
- Publish snapshots guarantee immutability for the most recent publish only; any
  consumer that needs to hold snapshots for longer must deep-clone the data.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- Struct-of-arrays `ResourceState` module checked into `packages/core`.
- Deterministic initialization from sample content definitions.
- Mutation helpers enforce caps, permit `Infinity` for uncapped resources, and
  prevent negative balances.
- `applyIncome`/`applyExpense` reject negative, `NaN`, or infinite rates while
  logging telemetry for diagnostics.
- `finalizeTick` converts per-second rates using `deltaMs / 1_000` and suppresses
  deltas whenever `epsilonEquals(appliedDelta, 0)` succeeds to keep deterministic
  behaviour.
- `requireIndex`/`assertValidIndex` guard invalid lookups with telemetry and
  exceptions.
- External consumers only mutate state through the façade; the module never
  hands out the live `ResourceStateBuffers`.
- Snapshot API returns immutable data compatible with `CommandRecorder`, and
  the engine guarantees the most recent publish snapshot remains immutable; any
  consumer that retains older snapshots must clone them explicitly.
- Snapshots expose zero-copy typed array views (read-only by contract) and honour
  the optional `SNAPSHOT_GUARDS` debug flag that wraps the arrays in write-throwing
  proxies without impacting the default fast path.
- `SNAPSHOT_GUARDS` defaults to enabled in development/test environments and can
  be explicitly toggled for production builds.
- Dirty index scratch list and `dirtyIndexPositions` map power delta publications
  without heap churn while keeping removals O(1).
- Snapshot comparison and dirty tracking both honour `epsilonEquals`, ensuring
  near-zero float noise does not keep resources marked dirty.
- `dirtyTolerance` values are sanitized during initialization or hydration and
  mirrored into both live and publish buffers; they remain immutable during
  per-tick mutations so the delta pipeline can ignore them without losing
  runtime changes.
- Publish mode replays the previous publish's dirty indices into the inactive
  buffer, zeros their tick deltas, and then applies the current tick's dirty
  updates so clean resources never incur full-buffer copies when buffers swap.
- `ResourcePublishTransport` payloads contain metadata describing each typed
  array and send only `dirtyCount` elements per field via a pooled buffer strategy.
- `reconcileSaveAgainstDefinitions` validates save payloads, enforces id parity,
  and reports mismatches instead of silently dropping data.
- `forceClearDirtyState()` provides an explicit non-publish reset path for tests
  while production flows continue to rely on publish.
- Save rehydration updates both live and publish buffers so the next publish
  reflects persisted state without a warm-up tick.
- Unit tests cover initialization, mutation, and snapshot behaviors.
