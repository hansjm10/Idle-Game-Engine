# @idle-engine/content-sample

Sample content pack used by the prototype milestone. The definitions here will ultimately be generated by the content DSL compiler and referenced by automated validation tests.

## Content validation

- Authoring sources live in `content/pack.json` and are parsed with `@idle-engine/content-schema` before being exported from `src/index.ts`.
- Running `pnpm generate` validates the pack and emits machine-readable `content_pack.*` log lines before regenerating runtime event manifests. Keep schema warnings at zero so downstream automation can treat any new warning as a regression.
- Follow-up work will migrate future DSL compiler output into this directory so the CLI remains the single entry-point for pack validation.

## Runtime event manifests

Custom runtime events for the sample pack live in `content/event-types.json`. After editing the manifest (or associated schema files) run `pnpm generate` from the repository root to regenerate:

- the consolidated manifest hash used by the command recorder
- `packages/core/src/events/runtime-event-manifest.generated.ts`
- the `ContentRuntimeEventType` union exported by `@idle-engine/core`

`sampleEventDefinitions` and `sampleEventTypes` in `src/index.ts` mirror the generated output to keep tests and examples in sync with the manifest.
