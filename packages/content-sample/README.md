# @idle-engine/content-sample

Sample content pack used by the prototype milestone. The definitions here will ultimately be generated by the content DSL compiler and referenced by automated validation tests.

## Runtime event manifests

Custom runtime events for the sample pack live in `content/event-types.json`. After editing the manifest (or associated schema files) run `pnpm generate` from the repository root to regenerate:

- the consolidated manifest hash used by the command recorder
- `packages/core/src/events/runtime-event-manifest.generated.ts`
- the `ContentRuntimeEventType` union exported by `@idle-engine/core`

`sampleEventDefinitions` and `sampleEventTypes` in `src/index.ts` mirror the generated output to keep tests and examples in sync with the manifest.
